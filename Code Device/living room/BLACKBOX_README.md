The following code is for a WiFi-enabled ESP32 board that will connect to a Wi-Fi network, receive sensor readings from a remote device, and display the readings on an LCD screen. The code also includes a function to update the firmware of the ESP32 board over the air (OTA).

**Step 1: Import the required libraries**

The following libraries are required for this project:

* `WiFi.h`
* `WiFiManager.h`
* `ESPhttpUpdate.h`
* `Servo.h`
* `SPI.h`
* `Adafruit_GFX.h`
* `Adafruit_PCD8544.h`

**Step 2: Define the constants**

The following constants are defined in the code:

* `currentVersion`: The current version of the firmware on the ESP32 board.
* `serverUrl`: The URL of the server where the firmware updates are stored.
* `broadcastAddress`: The MAC address of the remote device that will be sending sensor readings to the ESP32 board.
* `contrastValue`: The contrast value for the LCD screen.

**Step 3: Initialize the serial monitor**

The serial monitor is initialized at 115200 baud rate.

**Step 4: Connect to Wi-Fi**

The ESP32 board connects to the Wi-Fi network using the `WiFiManager` library. The `autoConnect()` function attempts to connect to a saved Wi-Fi network. If no saved networks are found, the `autoConnect()` function will create a new Wi-Fi network called `AutoConnectAP`.

**Step 5: Update the firmware**

The ESPhttpUpdate library is used to update the firmware of the ESP32 board over the air (OTA). The `update()` function checks for a new firmware update on the server and, if one is found, downloads and installs the update.

**Step 6: Initialize the servo motor**

The servo motor is attached to pin 13 of the ESP32 board.

**Step 7: Initialize ESP-NOW**

ESP-NOW is a wireless communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other without the need for a Wi-Fi network. ESP-NOW is initialized and a callback function is registered to be called when data is received.
