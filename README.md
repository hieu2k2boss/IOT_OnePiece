# IOT OnePiece

## Introduction
Smart Home is an intelligent automation system within a house that allows control and
management of various devices and systems such as lighting, air conditioning, doors,
security systems, audio, video, and other household appliances. This system is controlled
through smart mobile devices or voice commands, helping users save time, increase
convenience, and enhance safety in their daily lives. 
Providing a general overview of the accomplished content:
- Communication between sensors and ESP8266 and ESP32
- Pushing the collected data to Firebase
- Creating a React Native app to control devices within the Smart Home
- Facial recognition for door unlocking
- Implementing ESP NOW communication between 4 ESP devices
- Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates
## System Construction
The system structure consists of three components: Cloud, App and Device, as depicted
in the diagram below:

## Conclusion
While participating in the IoT challenge, we successfully executed the Smart Home
project. This encompassed acquiring expertise in connecting ESPs through the ESPNOW protocol, establishing ESP connections to Firebase Cloud, performing read and
write operations for sensor data, facilitating push and pull interactions with Firebase,
controlling devices through a React Native app, and implementing facial recognition to
unlock doors.
